# If you're looking for an example debian/rules that uses debhelper, see
# the examples directory.
# 
# Each debhelper command in this rules file has to be run using ./run,
# to ensure that the commands and libraries in the source tree are used,
# rather than the installed ones.
#
# We use --no-parallel because the test suite is not thread safe.
# We disable autoreconf to avoid build-depending on it (it does
# nothing for debhelper and it keeps the set of B-D smaller)

%:
	./run dh $@ --no-parallel --without autoreconf

# Disable as they are unneeded (and we can then be sure debhelper
# builds without needing autotools-dev, dh-strip-nondetermism etc.)
