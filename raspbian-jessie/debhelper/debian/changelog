debhelper (10.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix typo in changelog entry for release 10.2.  Thanks to
    Peter Pentchev for reporting it.
  * Deprecate all compat levels lower than 9.
  * dh: Discard override log files before running the override
    rather than after.
  * dh_compress,dh_fixperms: Remove references to long
    obsolete directories such as usr/info, usr/man and
    usr/X11*/man.
  * autoreconf.pm: Apply patch from Helmut Grohne to fix
    autoconf/cross regression from #836988.  The autoreconf
    build-system is now also used directly for "clean" and
    "build" (while still usin the "make" build-system for the
    heavy lifting).  (Closes: #839681)
  * dh_installdirs: In compat 11, avoid creating debian/<pkg>
    directories except when required to do so.  This fixes a
    corner case, where an arch:all build would behave
    differently than an arch:all+arch:any when dh_installdir is
    optimised out only for the arch:all build.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Fix typo of positive.  Thanks to Matthias Klose
    for spotting it.

  * dh_installinit,dh_systemd_start: Introduce a new
    --no-stop-on-upgrade as an alternative to
    --no-restart-on-upgrade.  This new option should
    reduce the confusion of what it does.  Thanks to

    the initial patch.  (Closes: #836988)

debhelper (9.20160618) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh: Fix bug where "--help" or "--list" would not work
    unless "debian/compat" existed and had a supported
    compat level.  (Closes: #820508)
  * dh_compress: Gracefully handle debian (or any other

    Bernhard Miklautz for the report.  (Closes: #820711)

    This removes a confusing warning when the package is

    twice on all ELF binaries in the package.

    that dh_strip does not care about.

  * cmake.pm: Add better cross-compile support for cmake.
    Heavily based on a patch from Helmut Grohne.

    a regex.
  * dh_installinit: Create script snippts for tmpfiles.d
    files even if the package has no sysvinit script or
    explicit debian/<package>.service file.
    (Closes: #795519)
  * dh_makeshlibs: Revert passing -X to ldconfig in compat 10
    after talking with the glibc maintainer.  This is not the
    right place to make this change.
  * d/control: Remove the homepage field.
  * dh: Make dh_strip_nondeterminism optional, so debhelper
    does not need to build-depend on it.
  * dh_gencontrol/dh_builddeb: Temporarily stop building ddebs
    for udebs as dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-deb does not agree
    the default file extension for these.
  * dh_builddeb: Generate udebs with the correct filename even
    when "-V" is passed to dpkg-gencontrol.  This relies on
    dpkg-deb getting everything but the extension correct
    (see #575059, #452273 for why it does not produce the
     correct extension).
    (Closes: #516721, #677353, #672282)
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Drop now unused "udeb_filename" subroutine.

    reflect the current implementation (rather than the
    desired "state").  Thanks to Jakub Wilk for the report.

  * dh_fixperms: Reset permissions to 0644 for .js, .css,
    .jpeg, .jpg, .png, and .gif files.  Thanks to Ernesto
    Hernández-Novich for the suggestion.  (Closes: #595097)
  * dh_install: Read debian/not-installed if present as a
    list of files that are deliberately not installed.
    Files listed here will not cause dh_install to complain
    with --list-missing.  Thanks to Peter Eisentraut for the

    the debhelper maintainer script snippets into a maintainer
    script written in Perl.  Thanks to Jakub Wilk for

    times with different package names.  Thanks to Tristan
    Schmelcher for the suggestion.  (Closes: #776103)
  * dh,Buildsytems: In compat 10, default to --parallel.
  * dh,Buildsytems: Accept "--no-parallel" to disable
    parallel builds.  It is effectively the same as using
    --max-parallel=1 but may be more intuitive to some people.
  * dh_makeshlibs: Use a noawait trigger to invoke ldconfig
    rather maintscripts.
  * dh_installdirs.1: Add a note that many packages will work
    fine without calling dh_installdirs.  (Closes: #748993)
  * dh_compress: Apply patch from Rafael Kitover to support
    passing files to dh_compress that would have been
    compressed anyway.  (Closes: #794898)
  * Dh_Lib: Apply patch from Gergely Nagy to make debhelper
    export "DH_CONFIG_ACT_ON_PACKAGES" when executing an
    executable debhelper config file.  This is intended to
    assist dh-exec (etc.) in figuring what packages are
    acted on.  (Closes: #698054)
  * dh_movefiles: Expand globs in arguments passed in all
    compat levels (and not just compat 1 and 2).
    (Closes: #800332)
  * dh_installinit: Clearly document that --onlyscripts
    should generally be used with -p (or similar) to limit
    the number of affected packages.  (Closes: #795193)

  * dh_gencontrol: Stop explicitly passing -DSource to
    dpkg-gencontrol when building ddebs.  The passed value was
    wrong sometimes (e.g. with binNMUs) and dpkg-gencontrol
    since 1.18.2~ computes the value correctly.
  * d/control: Bump dependency on dpkg-dev to 1.18.2~ for
    ddebs.  Build-depends not bumped since debhelper itself
    does not produce any ddebs.
  * dh_makeshlibs: Continue generating reports from

  * dh: Now you can use override_dh_command-arch and override_dh_command-indep
    to run different overrides when building arch and indep packages. This
    allows for a much simplified form of rules file in this situation, where
    build-arch/indep and binary-arch/indep targets do not need to be manually
    specified. See man page for examples. Closes: #640965
    .
    Note that if a rules file has say, override_dh_fixperms-arch,
    but no corresponding override_dh_fixperms-indep, then the unoverridden
    dh_fixperms will be run on the indep packages.
    .
    Note that the old override_dh_command takes precidence over the new
    overrides, because mixing the two types of overrides would have been
    too complicated. In particular, it's difficult to ensure an
    old override target will work if it's sometimes constrained to only
    acting on half the packages it would normally run on. This would be 
    a source of subtle bugs, so is avoided.
  * dh: Don't bother running dh_shlibdebs, dh_makeshlibs, or dh_strip
    in the binary target when all packages being acted on are indep.

    rules file has explicit binary-indep and binary-arch targets.

    it does not understand; and it was not possible to fix that

  * dh_auto_clean: Inhibit logging, so that, if dh_auto_clean is used
    in some rule other than clean, perhaps to clean up an intermediate
    build before a second build is run, debian/rules clean still runs it.
    Closes: #615553
  * Started work on Debhelper v9. It is still experimental, and more
    changes may be added to that mode.
  * Support multiarch in v9. Thanks, Steve Langasek. Closes: #617761
  * dh_auto_configure: Support multiarch in v9 by passing multiarch
    directories to --libdir and --libexecdir.
  * dh_makeshlibs: Detect packages using multiarch directories and
    make ${misc:Pre-Depends} expand to multiarch-support.
  * Depend on dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.0) for multiarch support. Note to backporters:
    If you remove that dependency, debhelper will fall back to not doing
    multiarch stuff in v9 mode, which is probably what you want.

  * Improve handling of logging in override targets, so that
    --remaining-packages can be used again. Now all debhelper commands run

  * Started work on Debhelper v8. It is still experimental, and more

  * dh_installman: Avoid converting .so links to symlinks if the link
    target is not present in the same binary package, on advice of 
    Colin Watson. (To support eventual so search paths.)
  * Add deprecation warning for dh_clean -k.
  * dh_testversion: Removed this deprecated and unused command.
  * debian/compress files are now deprecated. Seems only one package
    (genesis) still uses them.
  * dh_fixperms: Tighten globs used to find library .so files,
    avoiding incorrectly matching things like "foo.sources". Closes: #583328
  * dh_installchangelogs: Support packages placing their changelog in a
    file with a name like HISTORY. Closes: #582749
  * dh_installchangelogs: Also look for changelog files in doc(s)
    subdirectories. Closes: #521258
  * In v8 mode, do not allow directly passing unknown options to debhelper
    commands. (Unknown options in DH_OPTIONS still only result in warnings.)
  * In v8 mode, dh_makeshlibs will run dpkg-gensymbols on all shared
    libraries it generates shlibs files for. This means that -X can be
    used to exclude libraries from processing by dpkg-gensymbols. It also
    means that libraries in unusual locations, where dpkg-gensymbols does
    not itself normally look, will be passed to it, a behavior change which
    may break some packages. Closes: #557603
  * In v8 mode, dh expects the sequence to run is always its first parameter.
    (Ie, use "dh $@ --foo", not "dh --foo $@")
    This avoids ambiguities when parsing options to be passed on to debhelper
    commands. (See #570039)
  * In v8 mode, prefer the perl_build buildsystem over perl_makemaker.
    Closes: #578805

    Closes: #570373
  * Typo. Closes: #571968
  * If neither -a or -i are specified, debhelper commands used to default
    to acting on all packages in the control file, which was a guaranteed
    failure if the control file listed packages that did not build for the
    target architecture. After recent optimisations, this default behavior
    can efficiently be changed to the more sane default of acting on only
    packages that can be built for the current architecture. This change
    is mostly useful when using minimal rules files with dh. Closes: #572077

    the corresponding file in /lib/udev. (Based on patch by
    Martin Pitt.) (Note that this file will not be deleted on purge -- 
    I can't see a good way to determine when it's appropriate to do
    that.)

debhelper (7.3.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * Modular object oriented dh_auto_* buildsystem support,
    contributed by Modestas Vainius
    - dh_auto_* --sourcedirectory can now be used to specify a source
      directory if sources and/or the whole buildsystem lives elsewhere
      than the top level directory. Closes: #530597
    - dh_auto_* --builddirectory can now be used to specify a build
      directory to use for out of source building, for build systems
      that support it. Closes: #480577
    - dh_auto_* --buildsystem can now be used to override the autodetected
      build system, or force use of a third-party class.
    - dh_auto_* --list can be used to list available and selected build
      systems.
    - Adds support for cmake.
    - For the perl_build build system, Build is used consistently
      instead of falling back to using the generated Makefile.
      Closes: #534332
    - Historical dh_auto_* behavior should be preserved despite these
      large changes..
  * Move two more command-specific options to only be accepted by the commands
    that use them. The options are:
    --sourcedir, --destdir
    If any third-party debhelper commands use either of the above options,
    they will be broken, and need to be changed to pass options to init().
  * Make dh not complain about unknown, command-specific options passed to it,
    and further suppress warnings about such options it passes on to debhelper
    commands. This was attempted incompletely before in version 7.2.17.

    via misc:Depends to handle partial upgrades. Note that while
    dh_installinfo already required that info files had a INFO-DIR-SECTION,
    the new system also requires they have START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY and
    END-INFO-DIR-ENTRY for proper registration. I assume there will be

  * rules.tiny: Typo fix. Closes: #479647
  * dh_installinit: Add --restart-after-upgrade, which avoids stopping a
    daemon in the prerm, and instead restarts it in the postinst, keeping
    its downtime minimal. Since some daemons could break if files are upgraded
    while they're running, it's not the default. It might become the default
    in a future (v8) compatibility level. Closes: #471060

  * dh: --with=foo can be used to include such third-party commands.
    So, for example, --with=cli could add the dh_cli* commands from
    cli-common.
  * Moved python-support special case out of dh and into a python-support
    sequence addon. --with=python-support is enabled by default to avoid

    daemons that use real root. Especially if cdbs is used, since it runs
    dh_listpackages after clean, thereby leaving behind log files that
    only root can touch. Avoid this particular special case by inhibiting

  * dh: New program that runs a series of debhelper commands in a sequence.
    This can be used to construct very short rules files (as short as 3
    lines), while still exposing the full power of debhelper when it's
    needed.
  * dh_auto_configure: New program, automates running ./configure,
    Makefile.PL, and python distutils. Calls them with exactly the same
    options as cdbs does by default, and allows adding/overriding options.
  * dh_auto_build: New program, automates building the package by either
    running make or using setup.py. (Support for cmake and other build systems
    planned but not yet implemented.)
  * dh_auto_test: New program, automates running make test or make check
    if the Makefile has such a target.
  * dh_auto_clean: New program, automates running make clean (or distclean,
    or realclean), or using setup.py to clean up.
  * dh_auto_install: New program, automates running make install, or using
    setup.py to install. Supports the PREFIX=/usr special case needed by
    MakeMaker Makefiles. (Support for cmake and other build systems planned
    but not yet implemented.)
  * New v7 mode, which only has three changes from v6, and is the new
    recommended default, especially when using dh.
  * dh_install: In v7 mode, if --sourcedir is not specified, first look for
    files in debian/tmp, and then will look in the current directory. This
    allows dh_install to interoperate with dh_auto_install without needing any
    special parameters.
  * dh_clean: In v7 mode, read debian/clean and delete all files listed
    therein.
  * dh_clean: In v7 mode, automatically delete *-stamp files.
  * Add a Makefile and simplify this package's own rules file using
    all the new toys.
  * dh_clean: Don't delete core dumps. (Too DWIM, and "core" is not
    necessarily a core dump.) Closes: #477391

  * Update french translation with recent change in dh_installmodules
  
  [ Joey Hess]
  * ACK last three NMUs with thanks to Raphael Hertzog for making the best of
    a difficult situation.
  * Revert all dh_python changes. Closes: #381389, #378604
  * Conflict with python-support <= 0.5.2 and python-central <= 0.5.4.
  * Make dh_python do nothing if debian/pycompat is found.
    The new versions of dh_pysupport or dh_pycentral will take care of
    everything dh_python used to do in this situation.
  * dh_python is now deprecated. Closes: #358392, #253582, #189474
  * move po4a to Build-Depends as it's run in clean.
  * Add size test, which fails on any debhelper program of more than 150
    lines (excluding POD). This is not a joke, and 100 lines would be better.
  * Add size test exception for dh_python, since it's deprecated.

debhelper (5.0.37.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Update of dh_python
    - when buidling for a non-standard Python version, generate more
      reasonable Depends like "python (>= X.Y) | pythonX.Y"
      Closes: #375576
    - fix handling of private extensions. Closes: #375948
    - fix parsing of XS-Python-Version, it didn't work if only fixed versions
      were listed in XS-Python-Version.
    - fix use of unitialized value. Closes: #374776
    - fix typos in POD documentation. Closes: #375936

debhelper (5.0.37.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Update of dh_python
    - vastly refactored, easier to understand, and the difference
      between old policy and new policy is easier to grasp
    - it supports an -X option which can be used to not scan some files
    - uses debian/pyversions as reference source of information for
      dependencies but also parse the XS-Python-Version header as fallback.
    - ${python:Versions}'s default value is XS-Python-Version's value
      instead of "all" when the package doesn't depend on a
      specific python version. Closes: #373853
    - always generate ${python:Provides} and leave the responsibility to the
      maintainer to not use ${python:Provides} if he doesn't want the
      provides.
    - uses debian/pycompat or DH_PYCOMPAT as reference field to run in new
      policy mode. The presence of XS-Python-Version will also trigger the
      new policy mode (this is for short-term compatibility, it may be removed in
      the not too-distant future).
      DH_PYCOMPAT=1 is the default mode and is compatible to the old policy.
      DH_PYCOMPAT=2 is the new mode and is compatible with the new policy.
  * Use "grep ^Version:" instead of "grep Version:" on the output of
    dpkg-parsechangelog since the above changelog entry matched "Version:" and
    thus made the build fail.

debhelper (5.0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmodules: depmod -a is no longer run during boot, so if a module
    package is installed for a kernel other than the running kernel, just
    running depmod -a in the postinst is no longer sufficient. Instead, run
    depmod -a -F /boot/System.map-<kvers> <kvers>
    The kernel version is guessed at based on the path to the modules in the
    package. Closes: #301424
  * dh_installxfonts: In postrm, run the deregistraton code even on upgrade,
    in case an upgrade involves moving fonts around (or removing or renaming
    fonts). Closes: #372686

    the new form of architecture wildcarding which allows use of things
    like "linux-any" and "any-i386" in the Architecture field. Closes: #371082
  * Needs dpkg-dev 1.13.13 for dpkg-architecture -s support needed by

    language codes from man page filenames. Only strip things that look like
    codes that match the specified languages. Closes: #366645
  * dh_installxfonts: /etc/X11/fonts/X11R7 is deprecated, back to looking in
    old location, and not passing --x11r7-layout to update-fonts-alias and
    update-fonts-scale (but still to update-fonts-dir). Closes: #366234

  * Add code for removing empty "lang" directories into man/ when cleaning.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * dh_installxfonts: pass --x11r7-layout to update-fonts-* commands to ensure
    they use the right new directory. Closes: #362820
  * dh_installxfonts: also, alias files have moved from /etc/X11/fonts/* to
    /etc/X11/fonts/X11R7/*, update call to update-fonts-alias and the man page
    accordingly; packages containing alias files will need to switch to the
    new directory on their own.

  * Convert the "I have no packages to build" error into a warning. Am I
    really the first person to run into the case of a source package that
    builds an arch all package and an single-arch package? In this case,
    the binary-arch target needs to use -s and do nothing when run on some
    other arch, and debhelper will now support this.

    /usr/share/fonts/X11/ -- look there for fonts as well as in the old
    location, although the old location probably won't be seen by X anymore.
  * dh_installxfonts: Generate misc:Depends on new xfonts-utils.

debhelper (5.0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improved po4a cleaning. Closes: #348521
  * Reverted change in 4.1.9, so generation of EXCLUDE_FIND escapes "." to
    "\\.", which turns into "\." after being run through the shell, and
    prevents find from treating -X.svn as a regexp that matches files such
    as foo/svn.vim. (It's safe to do this now that all uses of EXCLUDE_FIND are
    via complex_doit(), which was not the case of dh_clean when this change
    was originally made.) Closes: #349070

    set up maintainer script snippets, w/o installing any files.
    Useful for those edge cases where the init script is provided by upstream
    and not easily installed by dh_installinit but where it's worth letting
    it manage the maintainer scripts anyway. Closes: #140881, #184980
  * -o might be added for other similar commands later if there is any
    reason to. And yeah, it means that -no is close to a no-op..

debhelper (5.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * debhelper v5 mode is finalised and the new recommended compatibility
    level. Unless your package uses dh_strip --dbg-package, switching to v5

    adding comments to all your debhelper config files, so I recommend making
    the switch as soon as this version reaches testing.

debhelper (4.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles has long been a sore point in debhelper. Inherited
    from debstd, its interface and implementation suck, and I have maintained
    it while never really deigning to use it. Now there is a remplacment:
    dh_install, which ...
    - copies files, doesn't move them. Closes: #75360, #82649
    - doesn't have that whole annoying debian/package.files vs. debian/files
      mess, as it uses debian/install.
    - supports copying empty subdirs. Closes: #133037
    - doesn't use tar, thus no error reproting problems. Closes: #112538
    - files are listed relative to the pwd, debian/tmp need not be used at
      all, so no globbing issues. Closes: #100404
    - supports -X. Closes: #116902
    - the whole concept of moving files out of a directory is gone, so this
      bug doesn't really apply. Closes: #120026
    - This is exactly what Bill Allombert asked for in #117383, even though I
      designed it seemingly independantly. Thank you Bill! Closes: #117383
  * Made debhelper's debian/rules a lot simpler by means of the above.
  * Updated example rules file to use dh_install. Also some reordering and
    other minor changes.
  * dh_movefiles is lightly deprecated, and when you run into its bugs and
    bad design, you are incouraged to just use dh_install instead.
  * dh_fixperms: in v4 only, make all files in bin/ dirs +x. Closes: #119039
  * dh_fixperms: in v4 only, make all files in etc/init.d executable (of
    course there's -X ..)    
  * dh_link: in v4 only, finds existing, non-policy-conformant symlinks
    and corrects them. This has the side effect of making dh_link idempotent.
  * Added a -h/--help option. This seems very obvious, but it never occured to
    me before..
  * use v4 for building debhelper itself
  * v4 mode is done, you may now use it without fear of it changing.
    (This idea of this upload is to get v4 into woody so people won't run into
    many issues backporting from sarge to woody later on. Packages targeted
    for woody should continue to use whatever compatibility level they are
    using.)

debhelper (3.4.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to Benjamin Drieu <benj@debian.org>, dh_installdocs -X now works.
    I had to modify his patch to use cp --parents, since -P spews warnings
    now. Also, I made it continue to use cp -a if nothing is excluded,
    which is both faster, and means this patch is less likely to break
    anything if it turns out to be buggy. Also, stylistic changes.

debhelper (3.4.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduced the debian/compat file. This is the new, preferred way to say
    what debhelper compatibility level your package uses. It has the big
    advantage of being available to debhelper when you run it at the command
    line, as well as in debian/rules.
  * A new v4 feature: dh_installinit, in v4 mode, will use invoke-rc.d.
    This is in v4 for testing, but I may well roll it back into v3 (and
    earlier) once woody is released and I don't have to worry about breaking
    things (and, presumably, once invoke-rc.d enters policy).
  * Some debhelper commands will now build up a new substvars variable,
    ${misc:Depends}, based on things they know your package needs to depend
    on. For example, dh_installinit in v4 mode adds sysvinit (>= 2.80-1) to
    that dep list, and dh_installxfonts adds a dep on xutils. This variable
    should make it easier to keep track of what your package needs to depends
    on, supplimenting the ${shlibs:Depends} and ${perl:Depends} substvars.
    Hmm, this appears to be based loosely on an idea by Masato Taruishi
    <taru@debian.org>, filtered through a long period of mulling it over.
    Closes: #76352
  * Use the addsubstvar function I wrote for the above in dh_perl too.

debhelper (3.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Began work on v4 support (and thus the large version number jump), and it
    is only for the very brave right now since I will unhesitatingly break
    compatibility in v4 mode as I'm developing it. Currently, updating to v4
    mode will only make dh_makeshlibs -V generate shared library deps that
    omit the debian part of the version number. The reasoning behind this
    change is that the debian revision should not typically break binary
    compatibility, that existing use of -V is causing too tight versioned
    deps, and that if you do need to include the debian revision for some
    reason, you can always write it out by hand. Closes: #101497
  * dh_testversion is deprecated -- use build deps instead. A warning message
    is now output when it runs. Currently used by: 381 packages.
  * dh_installxaw is deprecated -- xaw-wrappers in no longer in the

    by: 3 packages (bugs filed).
  * Added referneces to menufile in dh_installmenu man page. Closes: #127978

    with any automatically determined substvars data. See bug #98819
  * I want to stress that no one should ever rely in internal, undocumented
    debhelper workings. Just because debhelper uses a certian name for some
    internally used file does not mean that you should feel free to modify
    that file to your own ends in a debian package. If you do use it, don't
    be at all suprised when it breaks. If you find that debhelper is lacking
    a documented interface for something that you need, ask for it!

    support a -- and options after it, do not require any special quoting
    of the succeeding options. Quote just like you would in whatever
    program those options go to. So, for example, 
    dh_gencontrol -Vblah:Depends='foo, bar (>= 1.2)' will work just as you
    would hope. This fix does NOT apply to -u; don't use -u if you must do

debhelper (3.0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: don't follow links to .so files. Instead, we will look
    for *.so* files. This should work for the variously broken db3,
    liballeg, and it will fix the problem with console-tools-dev, which
    contained (arguably broken) absolute symlinks to real files, which were

  * Modified to use dpkg-architecture instead of dpkg --print-architecture.
    I hate this, and wish it wasn't necessary to make cross compiles for
    the hurd work. Closes: #88494
  * Now depends on debconf-utils for debconf-mergetemplates. Closes: #87321
  * Continues to depend on lynx for html changelog conversions. Yes, these
    and packages with translated debconf templates are rather rare, but
    it makes more sense for debhelper to consistently depend on all utilities
    it uses internally rather than force people to keep their dependancies
    up to date with debhelper internals. If I decide tomorrow that w3m is
    the better program to use to format html changelogs, I can make the
    change and packages don't need to update their build dependancies.
    Closes: #88464, #77743
  * Test for init scripts before running them, since they are conffiles and
    the admin may have removed them for some reason, and policy wants

debhelper (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installman, a new program that replaces dh_installmanpages.
    It is not DWIM. You tell it what to install and it figures out where 
    based on .TH section field and filename extention. I reccommend everyone
    begin using it, since this is much better then dh_installmanpages's
    evilness. I've been meaning to do this for a very long time..
    Closes: #38673, #53964, #64297, #16933, #17061, #54059, #54373, #61816
  * dh_installmanpages remains in the package for backwards compatibility,
    but is mildly deprecated.
  * dh_testversion is deprecated; use build dependancies instead.
  * dh_suidregister: re-enabled. Aj thinks that requiring people to stop
    using it is unacceptable. Who am I to disagree with a rc bug report?
    Closes: #84910 It is still deprecated, and it will still whine at you
    if you use it. I appreciate the job everyone has been doing at
    switching to statoverrides..
  * Since dh_debstd requires dh_installmanpages (where do you think the
    latter's evil interface came from?), I have removed it. It was a nice
    thought-toy, but nobody really used it, right?
  * Since the from-debstd document walks the maintainer through running
    dh_debstd to get a list of debhelper commands, and since that document
    has really outlives its usefullness, I removed it too. Use dh-make
    instead.
  * dh_installman installs only into /usr/share/man, not the X11R6
    directory. Policy says "files must not be installed into
    `/usr/X11R6/bin/', `/usr/X11R6/lib/', or `/usr/X11R6/man/' unless this
    is necessary for the package to operate properly", and I really doubt
    a man page being in /usr/share/man is going to break many programs.
    Closes: #81853 (I hope the bug submitter doesn't care that
    dh_installmanpages still puts stuff in the X11R6/man directory.)
  * dh_undocumented now the same too now.
  * dh_installinit: installs debian/package.default files as /etc/default/
    files.
  * Updated to current perl coding standards (use strict, lower-case
    variable names, pod man pages).
  * Since with the fixing of the man page installer issue, my checklist for
    debhelper v3 is complete, I pronounce debhelper v3 done! Revved the
    version number appropriatly (a large jump; v3 changes less than I had
    planned). Note that I have no plans for a v4 at this time. :-)
  * Testing: I have used this new version of debhelper to build a large
    number of my own packages, and it seems to work. But this release
    touches every file in this package, so be careful out there..

debhelper (2.2.12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * suidmanager is obsolete now, and so is dh_suidmanager. Instead,
    packages that contain suid binaries should include the binaries suid in
    the .deb, and dpkg-statoverride can override this. If this is done
    to a program that previously used suidmanager, though, you need to
    conflict with suidmanager (<< 0.50).
  * Made dh_suidmanager check to see if it would have done anything before.
    If so, it states that it is obsolete, and refer users to the man
    page, which now explains the situation, and then aborts the build.
    If it would have done nothing before, it just outputs a warning that
    it is an obsolete program.

  * DH_COMPAT=3 now enables the following new features which I can't just
    turn on by default for fear of breaking backwards compatibility:
    - dh_makeshlibs makes the postinst/postrm call ldconfig. Closes: #77154
      Patch from Masato Taruishi <taru@debian.org> (modified). If you 
      use this, be sure dh_makeshlibs runs before dh_installdeb; many
      old rules files have the ordering backwards.
    - dh_installdeb now causes all files in /etc to be registered as
      conffiles.
    - debian/README is now supported: it is treated exactly like
      debian/README.Debian. Either file is installed as README.Debian in
      non-native packages, and now as just README in native packages.
      Closes: #34628
  * This is really only the start of the changes for v3, so use with
    caution..
  * dh_du has finally been removed. It has been deprecated for ages, and
    a grep of the archive shows that nothing is using it except biss-awt
    and scsh. I filed bugs on both almost exactly a year ago. Those bugs

    but only if they are files. This should make it more usable with
    rather stupidly broken libraries like db3, which do not encode the
    major version in their filenames. However, it cannot guess the major

  * dh_movefiles: no longer does the symlink ordering hack, as
    this is supported by dpkg itself now. Added a dependancy on
    dpkg-dev >= 1.7.0 to make sure this doesn't break anything.
  * While I'm updating for dpkg 1.7.0, I removed the -ldirectory hack
    from dh_shlibdeps; dpkg-shlibdeps has its own much more brutal hack to
    make this work. The switch is ignored now for backwards compatibility.

    showing it is doing that when in verbose mode.

    rules.multi2 still uses it, but it has comments explaining the caveats
    of the hack.

debhelper (2.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * I started work on debhelper v2 over a year ago, with a long list of
    changes I hoped to get in that broke backwards compatibility. That
    development stalled after only the most important change was made,
    although I did get out over 100 releases in the debhelper 2.0.x tree.
    In the meantime, lots of packages have switched to using v2, despite my
    warnings that doing so leaves packages open to being broken without
    notice until v2 is complete.
  * Therefore, I am calling v2 complete, as it is. Future non-compatible
    changes will happen in v3, which will be started soon. This means that
    by using debhelper v2, one major thing changes: debhelper uses
    debian/<package> as the temporary directory for *all* packages;
    debian/tmp is no longer used to build binary packages out of. This is
    very useful for multi-binary packages, and I reccommend everyone
    switch to v2.
  * Updated example rules files to use v2 by default.
  * Updated all documentation to assume that v2 is being used.
  * Added a few notes for people still using v1.
  * Moved all of the README into debhelper(1).

debhelper (2.0.89) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Jorgen `forcer' Schaefer <forcer at mindless.com> (much
    modified)to make dh_installwm use new window manager registration method,
    update-alternatives. Closes: #52156, #34684 (latter bug is obsolete)
  * Fixed $dh{flavor} to be upper-case.
  * Deprecated dh_installemavcsen --number; use --priority instead. Also,
    the option parser requires the parameter be a number now. And,
    dh_installwm now accepts --priority, and window manager packages should
    start using it.
  * dh_installwm now behaves like a proper debhelper command, and reads
    debian/<package>.wm too. This is a small behavior change; filenames
    specified on the command line no longer apply to all packages it acts
    on. I can't belive this program existed for 2 years with such a glaring
    problem; I guess most people don't need ot register 5 wm's in 3
    sub-packages. Anyway, it can handle such things now. :-)
  * Moved Dh_*.pm to /usr/lib/perl5/Debian/Debhelper. *big* change.

    hard links, and was suid, suidregister detected all the hard links as
    files that need to be registered. It looped, registering the first
    link, and then removing its suid bit. This messed up the registration
    of the other had links, since their permissions were now changed,
    leading to unpredictable results. The fix is to just not remove suid
    bits until all files have been registered.

    - This also Closes: #37092 come to think of it. 
  * dh_shlibdeps, dh_shlibdeps.1:
    - Added -X option, which makes it not examine some files. This is
      useful in rare cases. Closes: #51100 
    - Always pass "-dDepends" before the list of files, which makes it
      easier to specify other -d parameters in the uparams, and doesn't
      otherwise change the result at all. 
  * doc/TODO:
     - dh_installdebfiles is no longer a part of debhelper. This affects
      exactly one package in unstable, biss-awt, which has had a bug filed

    text version to changelog.gz. The dumping is done with lynx. 
    (Closes: #51099)
  * Dh_Getopt.pm: Modified it so any options specified after -- are added to

  * Added new dh_installxfonts script by Changwoo Ryu
    <cwryu@dor17988.kaist.ac.kr>. Closes: #46684
    I made some changes, though:
    - I rewrote lots of this script to be more my style of perl.
    - I removed all the verbisity from the postinst script fragment, since
      that is a clear violation of policy.
    - I made the postinst fail if the mkfontdir, etc commands fail, because
      this really makes more sense. Consider idempotency.
    - I moved the test to see if the font dir is really a directory into the
      dh_ script and out of the snippet. If the maintainer plays tricks on
      us, mkfontdir will blow up satisfactorally anyway.
    - So, the snippet is 9 lines long now, down from 20-some.
    - I realize this isn't following the reccommendations made in Brando^Hen's
      font policy. I'll fight it out with him. :-)
    - In postrm fragment, used rmdir -p to remove as many parent directories
      as I can.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Sep 1999 13:22:08 -0700

debhelper (2.0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * FHS complience. Patch from Johnie Ingram <johnie@netgod.net>.
    For the most part, this was a straight-forward substitution,
    dh_installmanpages needed a non-obvious change though.
  * Closes: #42489, #42587, #41732.
  * dh_installdocs: Adds code to postinst and prerm as specified in
    http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-ctte-9908/msg00038.html,
    to make /usr/doc/<package> a compatibility symlink to
    /usr/share/doc/<package>. Note that currently if something exists in
    /usr/doc/<package> when the postinst is run, it will silently not make
    the symlink. I'm considering more intellingent handing of this case.
  * Note that if you build a package with this version of debhelper, it will
    use /usr/share/man, /usr/share/doc, and /usr/share/info. You may need to
    modify other files in your package that reference the old locations.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Sep 1999 21:06:11 -0700

debhelper (2.0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * It turns out it's possible to set up make variables that are specific to
    a single target of a Makefile. This works tremendously well with
    DH_OPTIONS: no need to put "-i" or "-pfoo" after every debhelper command
    anymore.
  * debhelper.1: mentioned above technique.
  * examples/rules.multi: use the above method to get rid of -i's and -a's.
  * examples/rules.multi2: new file, example of a multi-binary package that
    works for arch-indep and arch-dependant packages, and also allows
    building of single binary packages independntly, via binary-<package>
    targets. It accomplishes all this using only one list of debhelper
    commands.
  * examples/*: removed source and diff targets. They've been obsolete for 2
    years -- or is it 3? No need for a nice error message on failure anymore.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  3 Sep 1999 11:28:24 -0700

debhelper (2.0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_shlibdeps: Fixed quoting problem that made it fail on weird file names.
    Patch from Devin Carraway <debianbug-debhelper@devin.com>, Closes: #44016

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  2 Sep 1999 13:40:37 -0700

debhelper (2.0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oops, dh_installpam was omitted from the package. Added back. 
    Closes: #43652

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Aug 1999 19:16:38 -0700

debhelper (2.0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * No user visible changes. Modified the package to interface better with
    my new local build system, which auto-updates the home page when a new
    debhelper is built.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Aug 1999 23:20:40 -0700

debhelper (2.0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected debian/fixlinks to make the correct debian/* symlinks needed
    for building debhelper.
  * Fixed rules file to create and populate examples and docs dirs. Oops.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Aug 1999 19:46:08 -0700

debhelper (2.0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: Handle trailing whitespace after Document: name. 
    Closes: #43148.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Aug 1999 10:23:17 -0700

debhelper (2.0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed makefile commit target.
  * Misc changes to make CVS dirs not be copies into package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Aug 1999 22:43:39 -0700

debhelper (2.0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Checked all of debhelper into CVS.
  * Removed Test.pm (we have perl 5.005 now)
  * Skip CVS dir when running tests.
  * Since CVS is so brain dead about symlinks, added a debian/fixlinks script.
    Modified debian/rules to make sure it's run if any of the symlinks are
    missing. Also, made Makefile a short file that sources debian/rules so
    it's always available.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Aug 1999 22:35:12 -0700

debhelper (2.0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Wow. It turns out dh_installdocs has been doing it wrong and doc-base
    files have the doc-id inside them. Applied and modified a patch from
    Peter Moulder <reiter@netspace.net.au> to make it use those id's instead
    of coming up with it's own. (Closes: #42650)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Aug 1999 10:24:10 -0700

debhelper (2.0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_perl: Patch from Raphael Hertzog <rhertzog@hrnet.fr> to allow
    specification on the command line of alternate paths to search for perl
    modules. (Closes: #42171)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Jul 1999 09:42:08 -0700

debhelper (2.0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinfo: fixed bug if a info file had no section.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Jul 1999 11:41:11 -0700

debhelper (2.0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installxaw: fixed multiple stanza problem, for real this time (patch
    misapplied last time). (Closes: #41862)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Jul 1999 13:00:09 -0700

debhelper (2.0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: compat() wasn't exported.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Jul 1999 12:49:52 -0700

debhelper (2.0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dh_lib.pm: when looking for debhelper files in debian/, test with -f,
    not with -e, because it might fail if you're building a package named,
    say, 'docs', with a temp dir of debian/docs. I don't anticipate this
    ever happenning, but it pays to be safe.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Jul 1999 21:00:04 -0700

debhelper (2.0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: only force-remove debian/tmp if in v2 mode. In v1 mode, we
    shouldn't remove it because we may only be acting on a single package.
    (Closes: #41689)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Jul 1999 19:00:15 -0700

debhelper (2.0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved /usr/lib/debhelper to /usr/share/debhelper for FHS compliance
    (#41174). If you used Dh_lib or something in another package, be sure to
    update your "use" line and declare an appropriate dependancy. (Closes:
    #41174)
  * dh_installxaw: Patch from Josip Rodin <joy@cibalia.gkvk.hr> to fix
    multiple-stanza xaw file support. (Closes: #41173)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Jul 1999 11:49:57 -0700

debhelper (2.0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: FHS fixes (#41058)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Jul 1999 13:07:49 -0700

debhelper (2.0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinfo: fixed #SECTION# substitution.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jul 1999 17:51:59 -0700

debhelper (2.0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * At long, long last, dh_installinfo is written. It takes a simple list of
    info files and figures out the rest for you. (Closes: #15717)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jul 1999 17:04:48 -0700

debhelper (2.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: compress changelog.html files. (Closes: #40626)
  * dh_installchangelogs: installs a link from changelog.html.gz to changelog.gz, 
    because I think it's important that upstream changelogs always be accessable
    at that name.
  * dh_compress: removed the usr/share/X11R6/man bit. Note part of FHS.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jul 1999 10:46:03 -0700

debhelper (2.0.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: added some FHS support. Though debhelper doesn't put stuff
    there (and won't until people come up with a general transition strategy or
    decide to not have a clean transiotion), dh_compress now compresses
    various files in /usr/share/{man,doc,info}. (Closes: #40892)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jul 1999 09:55:03 -0700

debhelper (2.0.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_*: redirect cd output to /den/null, because CD can actually output
    things if CDPATH is set.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Jul 1999 10:14:00 -0700

debhelper (2.0.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_perl calls to example rules files.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Jul 1999 15:57:51 -0700

debhelper (2.0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now depends on perl5 | perl, I'll kill the | perl bit later on, but it
    seems to make sense for the transition.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Jul 1999 10:56:03 -0700

debhelper (2.0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: clean debian/tmp even if v2 is being used. If you're
    using dh_movefiles, stuff may well be left in there, and it needs to be
    cleaned up.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Jul 1999 13:23:46 -0700

debhelper (2.0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Raphael Hertzog <rhertzog@hrnet.fr> to make dh_perl support a
    -d flag that makes it add a dependancy on the sppropriate perl-XXX-base
    package. Few packages will really need this. (Closes: #40631)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Jul 1999 11:22:00 -0700

debhelper (2.0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on file >= 2.23-1, because dh_perl uses file -b, introduced at
    that version. (Closes: #40589)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 14:41:12 -0700

debhelper (2.0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * If you're going to use v2, it's reccommended you call 
    "dh_testversion 2". Added a note about that to doc/v2.
  * Dh_Lib.pm compat: if a version that is greater than the highest
    supported compatibility level is specified, abort with an error. Perhaps
    there will be a debhelper v3 some day...

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 14:08:14 -0700

debhelper (2.0.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Actually include doc/v2 this time round.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 14:01:55 -0700

debhelper (2.0.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't let the version number fool you. Debhelper v2 is here, but just
    barely. That's what all the zero's mean. :-)
  * If DH_COMPAT=2, then debian/<package> will be used for the temporary
    build directory for all packages. debian/tmp is no more! (Well, except
    dh_movefiles still uses it.)
  * debhelper.1: documented this. 
  * Dh_lib.pm: added compat(), pass in a number, it returns true if the
    current compatibility level is equal to that number.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: documented that.
  * debhelper itself now builds using DH_COMPAT=2.
  * dh_debstd forces DH_COMPAT=1, because it needs to stay compatible with
    debstd after all.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 13:37:58 -0700

debhelper (1.9.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a release of debhelper in preparation for debhelper v2.
  * doc/v2: added, documented status of v2 changes.
  * README: mention doc/v2
  * debhelper.1: docuimented DH_COMPAT
  * examples/*: added DH_COMAPT=1 to top of rules files

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 13:16:41 -0700

debhelper (1.2.83) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_perl: fixed substvars typo. Urgency medium since a lot of people will
    be using this script RSN.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 11:44:05 -0700

debhelper (1.2.82) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinit: applied patch from Yann Dirson <ydirson@multimania.com>
    to make it look for init.d scripts matching the --init-script parameter.
    This is only useful if, like Yann, you have packages that need to install
    more than 1 init script.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jun 1999 11:38:05 -0700

debhelper (1.2.81) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_link: fixed bug #40159 and added a regression test for it. It was
    failing if it was given absolute filenames.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jun 1999 10:12:44 -0700

debhelper (1.2.80) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed perl version detection.
  * Changed call to find.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Jun 1999 16:48:53 -0700

debhelper (1.2.79) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_perl by Raphael Hertzog <rhertzog@hrnet.fr>. dh_perl handles
    finding dependancies of perl scripts, plus deleting those annoying
    .packlist files.
  * I don't think dh_perl is going to be useful until the new version of
    perl comes out.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Jun 1999 14:47:55 -0700

debhelper (1.2.78) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really include dh_installpam.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Jun 1999 09:00:36 -0700

debhelper (1.2.77) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installpam: new program by Sean <shaleh@foo.livenet.net>
  * Wrote man page for same.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Jun 1999 13:08:04 -0700

debhelper (1.2.76) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: Do not use chmod/chown -R at all anymore, instead it uses
    the (slower) find then chown method. Necessary because the -R methods will
    happyily attempt to chown a dangling symlink, which makes them fail.
    (Closes: #38911)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jun 1999 20:20:01 -0700

debhelper (1.2.75) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installemacsen: fixed perms of install, remove scripts.
    (closes: #39082)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jun 1999 14:42:12 -0700

debhelper (1.2.74) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: recognizes gzipped man pages and installs them.
    This is an experimental change, one problem is if your man page isn't
    already gzip-9'd, it will be in violation of policy. (closes: #38673)
  * The previous fix to dh_installemacsen was actually quite necessary - the
    x bit was being set!

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jun 1999 15:14:27 -0700

debhelper (1.2.73) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installemacsen: make sure files are installed mode 0644. Not strictly
    necessary since dh_fixperms fixes them if you have a wacky umask, but oh
    well. (Closes: 38900)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jun 1999 14:50:42 -0700

debhelper (1.2.72) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installemacsen: use debian/package.emacsen-startup, not
    debian/package.emacsen-init. The former has always been documented to
    work on the man page (closes: #38898).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jun 1999 14:16:57 -0700

debhelper (1.2.71) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a typo (closes: #38881)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jun 1999 13:23:23 -0700

debhelper (1.2.70) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: Properly quoted metacharacters in $dir in regexp.
    (#38263).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 25 May 1999 14:12:30 -0700

debhelper (1.2.69) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't include Test.pm in the binary package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 23 May 1999 19:29:27 -0700

debhelper (1.2.68) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/README: updated example of using #DEBHELPER# in a perl script, with
    help from Julian Gilbey.
  * dh_link: generate absolute symlinks where appropriate. The links
    generated before were wrong simetimes (#37774)
  * Started writing a regression test suite for debhelper. Currently covers
    only the above bugfix and a few more dh_link tests.
  * Tossed Test.pm into the package (for regression tests) until we get perl
    5.005 which contains that package. That file is licenced the same as perl.
  * dh_installchangelogs: force all installed files to be owned by root
    (#37655).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 16 May 1999 17:18:44 -0700

debhelper (1.2.67) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmodules: fixed type that made the program not work.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 12 May 1999 00:25:05 -0700

debhelper (1.2.66) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/rules.multi: dh_shlibdeps must be run before dh_gencontrol
    (#37346)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  9 May 1999 14:03:05 -0700

debhelper (1.2.65) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added to docs.

debhelper (1.2.64) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmime: new command (#37093, #32684).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  3 May 1999 13:37:34 -0700

debhelper (1.2.63) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installxaw: updated to work with xaw-wrappers 0.90 and above. It
    actually has to partially parse the xaw-wrappers config files now. 

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  2 May 1999 19:13:34 -0700

debhelper (1.2.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installemacsen: added support for site-start files. Added --flavor
    and --number to control details of installation. (#36832)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  2 May 1999 15:31:58 -0700

debhelper (1.2.61) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums.1: dh_md5sums is not deprecated, AFAIK, but the manpage has
    somehow been modified to say it was at version 1.2.45.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Apr 1999 19:54:04 -0700

debhelper (1.2.60) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installexamples.1: recycled docs fix.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Apr 1999 17:19:07 -0700

debhelper (1.2.59) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_builddeb: added --destdir option, which lets you tell it where
    to put the generated .deb's. Default is .. of course.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Apr 1999 22:02:01 -0700

debhelper (1.2.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * autoscripts/postinst-suid: use /#FILE# in elif test (#36297).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Apr 1999 22:33:52 -0700

debhelper (1.2.57) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: killed trailing spaces after diff: target

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Apr 1999 22:02:32 -0700

debhelper (1.2.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_suidregister: make the chown/chmod only happen if the file actually
    exists. This is useful if you have conffiles that have permissions and
    may be deleted. (#35845)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Apr 1999 13:35:23 -0700

debhelper (1.2.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * Various man page enhancements.
  * dh_md5sums: supports -X to make it skip including files in the
    md5sums (#35819).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Apr 1999 18:21:58 -0700

debhelper (1.2.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinit.1: man page fixups (#34160).
  * *.1: the date of each man page is now automatically updated when 
    debhelper is built to be the last modification time of the man page.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Apr 1999 20:28:00 -0700

debhelper (1.2.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: leave .taz and .tgz files alone. Previously trying to
    compress such files caused gzip to fail and the whole command to fail.
    Probably fixes #35677. Actually, it now skips files with a whole
    range of odd suffixes that gzip refuses to compress, including "_z" and
    "-gz".
  * dh_compress.1: updated docs to reflect this, and to give the new
    suggested starting point if you want to write your own debian/compress
    file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Apr 1999 02:20:14 -0700

debhelper (1.2.52) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmodules: new program, closes #32546.

debhelper (1.2.51) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another very minor typo fix.

debhelper (1.2.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * Very minor typo fix.

debhelper (1.2.49) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: if called with -X, was attempting to change permissions of
    even symlinks. This could have even caused it to follow the symlinks and
    modify files on the build system in some cases. Ignores them now. (#35102)

debhelper (1.2.48) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms.1: improved documentation. (#34968)

debhelper (1.2.47) unstable; urgency=low

    fragments inside a perl program -- the old method didn't work with shell

debhelper (1.2.45) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installwm.1: fixed two errors (#34534, #34535)

debhelper (1.2.44) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_fixperms: has been mostly broken when used with -X, corrected this.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Mar 1999 17:25:59 -0800

debhelper (1.2.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress.1: man page fixes (Closes: #33858).
  * dh_compress: now it can handle compressing arbitrary numbers of files,
    spawning gzip multiple times like xargs does, if necessary.
    (Closes: #33860)
  * Dh_Lib.pm: added xargs() command.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  9 Mar 1999 14:57:09 -0800

debhelper (1.2.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_m5sums: don't generate bogus md5sums file if the package contains no
    files. Yes, someone found a legitimate reason to do that.

debhelper (1.2.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * README: minor typo fix.

debhelper (1.2.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Let's just say 1.2.39 is not a good version of debhelper to use and
    leave it at that. :-)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Feb 1999 22:55:27 -0800

debhelper (1.2.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installcron: install files in cron.d with correct perms.

debhelper (1.2.38) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (1.2.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: Patch from Jim Pick <jim@jimpick.com>, fixes regexp error (Closes: #33431).
  * dh_installxaw: new program by Daniel Martin 
    <Daniel.Martin@jhu.edu>, handles xaw-wrappers integration.
  * dh_installxaw.1: wrote man page.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Feb 1999 17:32:53 -0800

debhelper (1.2.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress.1: Fixed typo in man page. (Closes: #33364)
  * autoscripts/postinst-menu-method: fixed typo. (Closes: #33376)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Feb 1999 13:45:18 -0800

debhelper (1.2.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dh_Lib.pm filearray(): Deal with multiple spaces and spaces at the 
    beginning of lines in files. (closes: #33161)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  9 Feb 1999 21:01:07 -0800

debhelper (1.2.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: added -d flag (also --dirs-only) that will make it clean only
    tmp dirs. (closes: #30807)
  * dh_installdocs: to support packages that need multiple doc-base files,
    will now look for debian/<package>.doc-base.<doc-id>.
  * dh_compress: removed warning message (harmless).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Feb 1999 17:48:33 -0800

debhelper (1.2.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: verbose_print() cd's.
  * dh_compress: clear the hash of hard links when we loop - was making
    dh_compress fail on multi-binary packages that had harlinks. Thanks to
    Craig Small for spotting this.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Feb 1999 20:19:37 -0800

debhelper (1.2.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_suidmanager: if it cannot determine the user name or group name from
    the uid or gid, it will pass the uid or gid to suidmanager. This should
    probably never happen, but it's good to be safe.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Feb 1999 16:00:35 -0800

debhelper (1.2.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinit.1: minor typo fix (closes: #32753)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  2 Feb 1999 14:32:46 -0800

debhelper (1.2.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: cut down the number of chmod commands that are executed
    from 3 to 1, no change in functionality.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Feb 1999 17:05:29 -0800

debhelper (1.2.29) unstable; urgency=high

  * Do not include bogus chsh, chfn, passwd links in debhelper binary!
    These were acidentially left in after dh_link testing I did as I was
    working on the last version of debhelper.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Jan 1999 20:26:46 -0800

debhelper (1.2.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_link: fixed bug that prevent multiple links to the same source from
    being made. (#23255)

debhelper (1.2.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * autoscripts/*menu*: "test", not "text"!

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jan 1999 15:18:52 -0800

debhelper (1.2.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: use prerm-doc-base script fragement. Was using
    postrm-doc-base, for some weird reason.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jan 1999 13:36:40 -0800

debhelper (1.2.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * autoscripts/*menu*: It turns out that "command" is like test -w, it will
    still return true if update-menus is not executable. This can
    legitimatly happen if you are upgrading the menu package, and it makes
    postinsts that use command fail. Reverted to using test -x. Packages
    built with debhelper >= 1.2.21 that use menus should be rebuilt.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 16 Jan 1999 13:47:16 -0800

debhelper (1.2.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: linux 2.1.x and 2.2.x differ from earlier versions in that
    they do not clear the suid bit on a file when the owner of that file
    changes. It seems that fakeroot behaves the same as linux 2.1 here. I
    was relying on the old behavior to get rid of suid and sgid bits on files.
    Since this no longer happens implicitly, I've changed to clearing the
    bits explicitly.
  * There's also a small behavior change involved here. Before, dh_fixperms
    did not clear suid permissions on files that were already owned by root.
    Now it does.
  * dh_fixperms.1: cleaned up the docs to mention that those bits are
    cleared.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jan 1999 16:54:44 -0800

debhelper (1.2.23) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (1.2.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reversed change in last version; don't clobber mode (#31628).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Jan 1999 15:01:25 -0800

debhelper (1.2.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: Added doc-base support, if debian/<package>.doc-base
    exists, it will be installed as a doc-base control file. If you use this,
    you probably want to add "dh_testversion 1.2.21" to the rules file to make
    sure your package is built with a new enough debhelper.
  * dh_installdocs: now supports -n to make it not modify postinst/prerm.
  * dh_suidregister: turned off leading 0/1 in permissions settings, until
    suidregister actually supports it.
  * autoscripts/*: instead of "text -x", use "command -v" to see if various
    binaries exist. This gets rid of lots of hard-coded paths.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 30 Dec 1998 22:50:04 -0500

debhelper (1.2.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: handle the hard link stuff properly, it was broken. Also
    faster now.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Dec 1998 19:53:03 -0500

debhelper (1.2.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_listpackages: new command. Takes the standard options taken by other
    debhelper commands, and just outputs a list of the binary packages a
    debhelper command would act on. Added because of bug #30626, and because
    of wn's truely ugly use of debhelper internals to get the same info (and
    because it's just 4 lines of code ;-).
  * dh_compress: is now smart about compressing files that are hardlinks.
    When possible, will only compress one file, delete the hardlinks, and
    re-make hardlinks to the compressed file, saving some disk space.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Dec 1998 22:26:41 -0500

debhelper (1.2.18) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_fixperms: was not fixing permissions of files in usr/doc/ to 644,
    this has been broken since version 1.2.3.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Dec 1998 23:35:35 -0800

debhelper (1.2.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: relaxed regexp to find library name and number a little so
    it will work on libraries with a major but no minor version in their
    filename (examples of such: libtcl8.0.so.1, libBLT-unoff.so.1)
  * dh_movefiles: added --sourcedir option to make it move files out of 
    some directory besides debian/tmp (#30221)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Dec 1998 13:56:57 -0800

debhelper (1.2.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installchangelogs: now detects html changelogs and installs them as
    changelog.html.gz, to comply with latest policy (which I disagree with
    BTW).
  * manpages: updated policy version numbers.
  * dh_installdocs: behavior change: all docs are now installed mode 644.
    I have looked and it doesn't seem this will actually affect any packages
    in debian. This is useful only if you want to use dh_installdocs and not
    dh_fixperms, and that's the only time this behavior change will have any
    effect, either. (#30118)

debhelper (1.2.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really fixed #29762 this time. This also fixes #30025, which asked that
    dh_makeshlibs come before dh_shlibdeps, so the files it generates can
    also be used as a shlibs.local file, which will be used by dh_shlibdeps.

debhelper (1.2.13) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (1.2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: moved dh_makeshlibs call to before dh_installdeb call.
    (#29762). This is just so if you replace dh_makeshlibs with something
    that generates debian/shlibs, it still gets installed properly.
  * dh_suidregister: use names instead of uid's and gid's, at request of
    suidregister maintainer (#29802).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Nov 1998 13:13:10 -0800

debhelper (1.2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: if given absolute filenames to move (note that that is
    *wrong*), it will move relative files anyway. Related to bug #29761.
  * dh_link: made relative links work right. (I hope!)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Nov 1998 20:21:51 -0800

debhelper (1.2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: added dh_link calls to example rules files.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Nov 1998 15:43:07 -0800

debhelper (1.2.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_link, which generates policy complient symlinks in binary
    packages, painlessly.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Nov 1998 18:43:36 -0800

debhelper (1.2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Suggest dh-make (#29376).

debhelper (1.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (1.2.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: fixed non-integer comparison (#29476)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Nov 1998 13:03:09 -0800

debhelper (1.2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The perl conversion is complete.
  .
  * dh_compress: perlized (yay, perl has readlink, no more ls -l | awk 
    garbage!)
  * dh_lib, dh_getopt.pl: deleted, nothing uses them anymore.
  * debian/rules: don't install above 2 files.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: removed all documentation of the old shell library
    interface.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Nov 1998 15:36:57 -0800

debhelper (1.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_debstd, dh_movefiles: perlized.
  * dh_debstd: fixed -c option.
  * dh_installinit: fixed minor perl -w warning.
  * Only 1 shell script remains! (But it's a doozy..)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Nov 1998 13:29:39 -0800

debhelper (1.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms, dh_installdebfiles, dh_installdeb: perlized
  * dh_suidregister: perlized, with help from Che_Fox (and Tom Christianson,
    indirectly..).
  * dh_suidregister: include leading 0 (or 1 for sticky, etc) in file
    permissions.
  * Only 3 more to go and it'll be 100% perl.
  * Made $dh{EXCLUDE_FIND} available to perl scripts.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Nov 1998 15:47:43 -0800

debhelper (1.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_du, dh_shlibdeps, dh_undocumented: rewrite in perl.
  * dh_undocumented: shortened the symlink used for section 7 undocumented
    man pages, since it can link to undocuemented.7.gz in the same directory.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Nov 1998 13:40:22 -0800

debhelper (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip, dh_installinit: rewrite in perl.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Nov 1998 20:04:12 -0800

debhelper (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * A new unstable dist means I'm back to converting more of debhelper to
    perl.. Since 1.1 has actually stabalized, I've upped this to 1.2.
  * dh_md5sums: rewritten in perl, for large speed gain under some
    circumstances (old version called perl sometimes, once per package.)
  * dh_installmenu, dh_installemacsen, dh_installwm: perlized.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: made autoscript() really work.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Nov 1998 13:04:16 -0800

debhelper (1.1.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_suidregister: remove suid/sgid bits from all files registered. The
    reason is this: if you're using suidmanager, and you want a file that
    ships suid to never be suid on your system, shipping it suid in the .deb
    will create a window where it is suid before suidmanager fixes it's
    permissions. This change should be transparent to users and developers.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Oct 1998 18:19:48 -0800

debhelper (1.1.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: At the suggestion of James Troup <james@nocrew.org> now deletes
    files named *.P in .deps/ subdirectories. They are generated by automake.

debhelper (1.1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: quoting fix from Roderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org>
  * Added support for register-window-manager command which will be in a new
    (as yet unreleased) xbase. Now a new dh_installwm program handles
    registration of a window manager and the necessary modifications to
    postinst and postrm. It's safe to go ahead and start using this for your
    window manager packages, just note that it won't do anything until the new
    xbase is out, and that due to the design of register-window-manager, if
    your wm is installed before a xbase that supports register-window-manager
    is installed, the window manager will never be registered. (#20971)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Oct 1998 23:08:04 -0700

debhelper (1.1.21) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (1.1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a --same-arch flag, that is useful in the rare case when you have
    a package that builds only for 1 architecture, as part of a multi-part,
    multi-architecture source package. (Ie, netscape-dmotif).
  * Modified dh_installinit -r so it does start the daemon on the initial
    install (#26680).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Oct 1998 15:55:13 -0700

debhelper (1.1.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: look at basename of man pacges specified on command
    line to skip, for backwards compatibility.

debhelper (1.1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installemacsen: substitute package name for #PACKAGE# when setting
    up postinst and prerm (#26560).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Sep 1998 14:24:30 -0700

debhelper (1.1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip: on Richard Braakman's advice, strip the .comment and .note
    sections of shared libraries.
  * Added DH_OPTIONS environment variable - anything in it will be treated
    as additional command line arguments by all debhelper commands. This in
    useful in some situations, for example, if you need to pass -p to all
    debhelper commands that will be run. If you use DH_OPTIONS, be sure to
    use dh_testversion 1.1.17 - older debhelpers will ignore it and do
    things you don't want them to.
  * Made -N properly exclude packages when no -i, -a, or -p flags are
    present. It didn't before, which was a bug.

debhelper (1.1.16) unstable; urgency=low

    shared libraries. (#26414)

debhelper (1.1.15) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installmanpages: the new perl version had a nasty habit of 
    installing .so.x library files as man pages. Fixed.
  * dh_installmanpages: the code to exclude searching for man pages in
    debian/tmp directories was broken. Fixed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Aug 1998 00:05:17 -0700

debhelper (1.1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debhelper now has a web page at http://kitenet.net/programs/debhelper/

  * Added code to debian/rules to update the web page when I release new
    debhelpers.
  * dh_compress: since version 0.88 or so, dh_compress has bombed out if
    a debian/compress file returned an error code. This was actually
    unintentional - in fact, the debian/compress example in the man page
    will fail this way if usr/info or usr/X11R6 is not present. Corrected
    the program to not fail. (#26214)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Aug 1998 22:15:44 -0700

debhelper (1.1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: rewritten in perl. Allows me to fix bug #26221 (long
    symlink problem after .so conversion), and is about twice as fast.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 29 Aug 1998 22:06:06 -0700

debhelper (1.1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: forgot to pass package name to isnative(). Any native
    debian package that had a debian/TODO would have it installed with the
    wrong name, and debhelper would warn of undefined values for some
    packages. Fixed.

debhelper (1.1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installchangelogs: added -k flag, that will make it install a symlink
    to the original name of the upstream changelog.

debhelper (1.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * It's come to my attention that a few packages use filename globbing in
    debian/{docs,examples,whatever} files and expect that to work. It used
    to work before the perl conversion, but it was never _documented_, or
    intented to work. If you use this in your packages, they are broken and
    need fixing (and will refuse to build with current versions of debhelper).
    I apologize for the inconvenience.

  * dh_clean: fixed a bug, intorduced in version 1.1.8, where it didn't
    remove debian/files properly.
  * dh_shlibdeps, dh_testdir, dh_testroot, dh_testversion: converted to perl.
  * Encode the version of debhelper in a sepererate file, so dh_testversion
    doesn't have to be generated when a new version of debhelper is built.
  * Removed bogus menu file.

  * Dh_Lib.pm: fixed bug in the escaping code, numbers don't need to be
    escaped. Also, no longer escape "-".
  * dh_clean, dh_gencontrol, dh_installcron: converted to perl.
  * dh_gencontrol.1, dh_gencontrol: the man page had said that
    --update-rcd-params was equivilant to -u for this program. You should
    really use --dpkg-gencontrol-params.

debhelper (1.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_builddeb, dh_installchangelogs: converted to perl.
  * dh_installdirs: converted to perl, getting rid of nasty chdir en-route.
  * dh_installdirs: now you can use absolute directory names too if you
    prefer.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: updated to cover new perl modules.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: doit(): when printing out commands that have run, escape
    metacharacters in the output. I probably don't escape out all the
    characters I should, but this is just a convenience to the user anyway.
  * dh_installdebfiles: it's been broken forever, I fixed it. Obviously
    nobody uses it anymore, which is good, since it's deprected :-)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Aug 1998 15:23:34 -0700

debhelper (1.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: fixed bug introduced in 1.1.1 where it would fail in some
    cases if you tried to move a broken symlink.
  * dh_installdocs: was only operating on the first package.
  * dh_installexamples: rewritten in perl.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: all multiple package operations were broken.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: implemented complex_doit() and autoscript().
  * Made all perl code work with use strict and -w (well, except
    dh_getopt.pl, but that's a hack that'll go away one day).
  * I didn't realize, but rewriting dh_installdocs in perl fixed bug #24686
    (blank lines in debian/docs file problem), although this same problem 
    applies to other debhelper programs... like dh_installexamples, which had
    the same bug fixed when I rewrote it in perl just now.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: accidentially didn't check DH_VERBOSE if commands were not
    passed any switches.
  * Dh_Getopt.pm: --noscripts was broken.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Aug 1998 12:44:04 -0700

debhelper (1.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: -x was broken since version 1.1.1 - fixed.
  * dh_lib: removed get_arch_indep_packages() function that hasn't been used
    at all for a long while.
  * Added Dh_Lib.pm, a translation of dh_lib into perl.
  * dh_getopt.pl: moved most of it into new Dh_Getopt.pm module, rewriting
    large chunks in the process.
  * dh_installdocs: completly rewritten in perl. Now it's faster and it can
    install many oddly named files it died on before.
  * dh_installdocs: fixed a bug that installed TODO files mode 655 in native
    debian packages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Aug 1998 15:01:15 -0700

debhelper (1.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip: added -X to specify files to not strip (#25590).
  * Added dh_installemacsen, for automatic registration with emacsen-common
    (#21401).
  * Preliminary thoughts in TODO about converting entire debhelper programs
    to perl programs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Aug 1998 13:35:17 -0700

debhelper (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: try to move all files specified, and only then bomb out if
    some of the file could not be found. Makes it easier for some packages
    that don't always have the same files in them.
  * dh_compress: any parameters passed to it on the command line specify
    additional files to be compressed in the first package acted on.
  * dh_compress: recognize standard -A parameter.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Aug 1998 22:48:01 -0700

debhelper (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New unstable branch of debhelper.
  
  * TODO: list all current bugs, in order I plan to tackle them.
  * Added debhelper.1 man page, which groups all the debhelper options that
    are common to all commands in once place so I can add new options w/o
    updating 27 man pages.
  * dh_*.1: updated all debheper man pages to refer to debhelper(1) where
    appropriate. Also corrected a host of little errors.
  * doc/README: moved a lot of this file into debhelper.1.
  * dh_*: -N option now excludes a package from the list of packages the 
    programs act on. (#25247)

debhelper (1.0) stable unstable; urgency=low

  * 1.0 at last!
  
  * This relelase is not really intended for stable. I throw a copy into
    stable-updates because I want it to be available as an upgrade for
    people using debian 2.0 (the current version in debian 2.0 has no
    critical bugs, but this version is of course a lot nicer), and I plan
    to start work on a new branch of debhelper that will fix many wishlist
    bug reports, and of course introduce many new bugs, and which will go
    into unstable only.

  * dh_compress: applied patch from Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    to make it not fail if there are no candidates for compression (#24654).
  * Removed a whole debhelper-0.96 tree that had crept into the source
    package by accident.

debhelper (0.98) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: isnative: pass -l<changelog> to dpkg-parsechangelog, to support
    odd packages with multiple different debian changelogs.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: cleaned up the docs on DH_EXCLUDE_FIND.

debhelper (0.97) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/from-debstd: fixed a typo.
  * examples/*: install-stamp no longer depends on phony build targey; now 
    install-stamp depends on build-stamp instead (#24234).
  * dh_fixperms: applied patch from Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    to fix bad uses of the find command, so it should now work on packages 
    with files with spaces in them (#22005). It's also much cleaner. Thanks,
    Herbert!
  * dh_getopt.pl, doc/PROGRAMMING: added DH_EXCLUDE_FIND, to make the above
    fix work.

debhelper (0.96) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.94) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: fixed so it handles spaces and other odd characters in 
    filenames correctly. (#23046, #23700, #22010)
  * As a side effect, got rid of the nasty temporary file dh_md5sums used
    before.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Jun 1998 16:14:42 -0700

debhelper (0.93) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on file, since several dh_*'s use it.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Jun 1998 21:43:51 -0700

debhelper (0.92) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_gencontrol: pass -isp to dpkg-gencontrol to make it include section
    and priority info in the .deb file. Back in Jan 1998, this came up, and
    a consensus was reached on debian-devel that it was a good thing for
    -isp to be used.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Jun 1998 16:15:24 -0700

debhelper (0.91) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.90) unstable; urgency=low

  * I'd like to thank Len Pikulski and Igor Grobman at nothinbut.net for
    providing me with free internet access on a moment's notice, so I could
    get this package to you after hacking on it all over New England for the
    past week. Thanks, guys!
  .
  * Added dh_debstd, which mimics the functionality of the debstd command.
    It's not a complete nor an exact copy, and it's not so much intended to
    be used in a debian/rules file, as it is to be run by hand when you are
    converting a package from debstd to debhelper. "dh_debstd -v" will
    output the sequence of debhelper commands that approximate what debstd
    would do in the same situation.
  * dh_debstd is completly untested, I don't have the source to any packages
    that use debstd available. Once this is tested, I plan to release 
    debhelper 1.0!
  * Added a from-debstd document that gives a recipe to convert from debstd
    to debhelper.
  * dh_fixperms: can now use -X to exclude files from having their
    permissions changed.
  * dh_testroot: test for uid == 0, instead of username == root, becuase
    some people enjoy changing root's name.
  * dh_installinit: handle debian/init.d as well as debian/init files, 
    for backwards compatibility with debstd. Unlike with debstd, the two
    files are treated identically.
  * dh_lib, PROGRAMMING: added "warning" function.
  * Minor man page fixes.
  * dh_compress: don't bomb out if usr/doc/<package> is empty. (#23054)
  * dh_compress, dh_installdirs: always cd into $TMP and back out, even if
    --no-act is on. (#23054)

debhelper (0.88) unstable; urgency=low

  * I had many hours on a train to hack on debhelper... enjoy!
  * dh_compress: always pass -f to gzip, to force compression.
  * dh_compress: added -X switch, to make it easy to specify files to
    exclude, without all the bother of a debian/compress script. You can
    use -X multiple times, too.
  * PROGRAMMING, dh_getopt.pl: DH_EXCLUDE is now a variable set by the
    --exclude (-X) switch. -x now sets DH_INCLUDE_CONFFILES.

debhelper (0.87) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip: strip .comment and .note, not comment and note, when stripping
    elf binaries. This makes for smaller output files. This has always been
    broken in debhelper before! (#22395)

debhelper (0.86) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: don't try to re-compress *.gz files. Eliminates warning
    messages in some cases, shouldn't actually change the result at all.

debhelper (0.85) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved a few things around that were broken by Che's patch:
    - dh_installdirs should go in install target.
    - dh_clean should not run in binary targets.
  * This is just a quick fix to make it work, I'm not happy with it. I'm
    going to discuss my problems with it with Che, and either make a new
    version fixing them, or revert to 0.83.
  * So be warned that the example rules files are not currently in good
    shape if you're starting a new package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Apr 1998 23:30:38 -0700

debhelper (0.84) unstable; urgency=low

    properly. Note that version 0.80 and 0.81 could not build some packages

debhelper (0.80) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved under cvs (so I can fork a stable and an unstable version).
  * dh_movefiles: first move real files, then move symlinks. (#18220)
    Thanks to Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com> and Adam Heath 
    <adam.heath@usa.net> for help on the implementation.
  * dh_installchangelogs: use debian/package.changelog files if they exist
    rather than debian/changelog. It appears some people do need per-package
    changelogs.
  * dh_gencontrol: if debian/package.changelogs files exist, use them.
  * Above 2 changes close #20442.

debhelper (0.78) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * More spelling fixes from Christian T. Steigies. (I ignored the spelling
    fixes to the changelog, though - too many, and a changelog isn't meant
    to be changed after the fact :-)
  * dh_fixperms: remove execute bits from .la files genrated by libtool.

debhelper (0.71) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: -V flag was broken: if just -V was specified,
    dh_makeshlibs would die. Corrected this.
  * dh_lib: removed warning if the arguments passed to a debhelper command
    do not apply to the main package. It's been long enough so I'm 100% sure
    no packages use the old behavior.

debhelper (0.70) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_{installdirs,installdocs,installexamples,suidregieter,undocumented}:
    behavior modification - any files/directories specified on the command
    line now apply to the first package acted on. This may not be the
    first package listed in debian/control, if you use -p to make it act on
    a given package, or -i or -a.
  * If you take advantage of the above new behavior, I suggest you add
    "dh_testversion 0.50" to your debian/rules.
  * Display a warning message in cases where the above behavior is triggered,
    and debhelper's behavior has altered.
  * I have grepped debian's source packages, and I'm quite sure this
    is not going to affect any packages currently in debian.
  * dh_lib: isnative() now caches its return value, which should optimize
    away several more calls to dpkg-parsechangelog.
  * README: explain a way to embed debhelper generated shell script into a
    perl script.
  * dh_installinit: A hack to work around the problem in getopt(1) that
    led to bug report #16229: Any text specified on the command line that is
    not a flag will be presumed to be part of the -u flag. Yuck.

debhelper (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_du: Fixed hardcoded debian/tmp.
  * This change got lost by accident, redid it: Optimized out most of the
    slowdown caused by using dpkg-parsechangelog - now it's only called by
    2 dh_* programs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Dec 1997 20:45:22 -0500

debhelper (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_undocumented: exit with an error message if the man page specified
    does not have a section.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Dec 1997 14:14:04 -0500

debhelper (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: use dpkg-parsechangelog instead of parsing it by hand. This
    makes a package build slower (by about 30 seconds, on average), so
    I might remove it or optimize it if too many people yell at me. :-)
  * dh_undocumented.1: note that it really links to undocumented.7.gz.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Dec 1997 22:19:39 -0500

debhelper (0.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo #16215.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Dec 1997 14:41:46 -0500

debhelper (0.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: use prefix, instead of PREFIX, becuase autoconf uses that.
    Also, use `pwd`/debian/tmp, instead of debian/tmp.
  * Always substitute #DEBHELPER# in maintainer scripts, even if it expands
    to nothing, for neatness and to save a few bytes. #15863
  * dh_clean: added -k parameter to not delete debian/files. #15789
  * examples/*: use dh_clean -k in the binary targets of all rules files,
    for safety.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Dec 1997 19:05:41 -0500

debhelper (0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split dh_installdebfiles into 3 programs (dh_installdeb, dh_shlibdeps,
    and dh_gencontrol). dh_installdebfiles still works, but is depricated.
  * Added an examples/rules.indep file.
  * examples/rules.multi: changed dh_du -a to dh_du -i in binary-indep
    section.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Dec 1997 19:53:13 -0500

debhelper (0.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed man page typos #15685.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Dec 1997 21:44:58 -0500

debhelper (0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sumes, dh_installdirs, dh_compress: fixed assorted cd bugs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Dec 1997 15:08:36 -0500

debhelper (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: don't expand text passed to doit() a second time. This fixes
    #15624, and hopefully doesn't break anything else.
  * A side effect of this (of interest only to the debhelper programmer) is
    that doit() can no longer handle complex commands now. (ie, pipes, `;',
    `&', etc separating multiple commands, or redirection)
  * dh_makeshlibs, dh_md5sums, dh_installdebfiles, dh_du, dh_clean, 
    dh_installdirs: don't pass complex commands to doit().

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Dec 1997 13:56:14 -0500

debhelper (0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: fixes type that caused the program to crash (#15536).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  3 Dec 1997 13:22:48 -0500

debhelper (0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * README: fixed typoes (one serious).
  * Ran ispell on all the documentation.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Nov 1997 18:48:20 -0500

debhelper (0.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdirs: Do not create usr/doc/$PACKAGE directory. Bug #15498
  * README: documented that $PACKAGE can be used in the arguments to some of
    the dh_* programs (#15497).
  * dh_du.1: no, this is not really the dh_md5sums man page (#15499).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Nov 1997 13:01:40 -0500

debhelper (0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: was not reading debian/compress file - fixed.
  * examples/*: moved dh_clean call to after make clean is run.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Nov 1997 15:43:58 -0500

debhelper (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: no longer clean up empty (0 byte) files (#15240).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Nov 1997 14:29:37 -0500

debhelper (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now depends on fileutils (>= 3.16-4), becuase with any earlier version
    of fileutils, install -p will not work (#14680)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Nov 1997 23:59:43 -0500

debhelper (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: Install README.debian as README.Debian (of course,
    README.Debian is installed with the same name..)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Nov 1997 01:23:53 -0500

debhelper (0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinit: on removal, fixed how update-rc.d is called.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Nov 1997 20:43:14 -0500

debhelper (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installinit, which installs an init.d script, and edits the
    postinst, postrm, etc.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Nov 1997 00:45:53 -0500

debhelper (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmenu.1: menufile is in section 5, not 1.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 12 Nov 1997 19:54:48 -0500

debhelper (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: added source, diff targets that just print an error.
  * dh_clean: clean up more files - *.orig, *.rej, *.bak, .*.orig, .*.rej, 
    .SUMS, TAGS, and empty files.
  * dh_lib: doit(): use eval on parameters, instead of directly running
    them. This lets me clean up several nasty areas where I had to echo the
    commands once, and then run them seperatly.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Nov 1997 19:48:36 -0500

debhelper (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installdirs, automatically creates subdirectories (for
    compatibility with debstd's debian/dirs file.
  * dh_lib: fixed problem with -P flag.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Nov 1997 16:07:11 -0500

debhelper (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: always compress changelog and upstream changelog, no 
    matter what their size (#14604) (policy 5.8)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  6 Nov 1997 19:50:36 -0500

debhelper (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * README: documented what temporary directories are used by default for 
    installing package files into.
  * dh_*: added -P flag, to let a different package build directory be
    specified.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  6 Nov 1997 15:51:22 -0500

debhelper (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: leave permissions on files in /usr/doc/packages/examples
    unchanged.
  * Install examples/rules* executable.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Oct 1997 12:42:33 -0500

debhelper (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_makeshlibs, automatically generates a shlibs file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 1997 20:33:14 -0400

debhelper (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed mispelling of dh_md5sums in examples rules files and README.
    (#13990) Thanks, Adrian.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 1997 14:35:30 -0400

debhelper (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: behavior modification: do not generate md5sums for conffiles.
    (Thanks to Charles Briscoe-Smith <cpb4@ukc.ac.uk>) #14048.
  * dh_md5sums: can generate conffile md5sums with -x parameter.
  * Added a "converting from debstd" section to the README.
  * Added dh_du, generates a DEBIAN/du file with disk usage stats (#14048).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Oct 1997 13:17:28 -0400

debhelper (0.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installdebfiles: fixed *bad* bug that messed up the names of all
    files installed into DEBIAN/ for multiple binary packages.
  * dh_md5sums: fixed another serious bug if dh_md5sums was used for
    multiple binary packages.
  * If you have made any multiple binary packages using debhelper, you
    should rebuild them with this version.
  * dh_md5sums: show cd commands in verbose mode.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 1997 14:44:30 -0400

debhelper (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_suidregister, interfaces to to the suidmanager package.
  * dh_installdebfiles: fixed typo on man page.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Oct 1997 20:55:39 -0400

debhelper (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_md5sum, generates a md5sums file.
  * dh_clean: fixed to echo all commands when verbose mode is on.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 17 Oct 1997 14:18:26 -0400

debhelper (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sped up some things by removing unnecesary for loops.
  * dh_installdocs: behavior modifcation: if there is a debian/TODO, it is
    named like a debian/changelog file: if the package is a debian native
    package, it is installed as TODO. If the package is not a native package,
    it is installed as TODO.Debian.
  * dh_installdocs: handle debian/README.Debian as well as
    debian/README.debian.
  * Added dh_undocumented program, which can set up undocumented.7 symlinks.
  * Moved dh_installdebfiles to come after dh_fixperms in the example rules
    files. (dh_installdebfiles makes sure it installs things with the proper
    permissions, and this reorganization makes the file a bit more flexable
    in a few situations.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Oct 1997 20:08:05 -0400

debhelper (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of bashisms - this package should work now if /bin/sh is ash.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Oct 1997 15:24:40 -0400

debhelper (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installcron to install cron jobs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 30 Sep 1997 19:37:41 -0400

debhelper (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_strip to strip binaries and libraries.
  * Fixed several man pages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Sep 1997 20:46:32 -0400

debhelper (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for automatic generation of debian install scripts to
    dh_installmenu and dh_installdebfiles and dh_clean.
  * Removed some pointless uses of cat.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Sep 1997 21:52:53 -0400

debhelper (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved out of unstable, it still has rough edges and incomplete bits, but
    is ready for general use.
  * Added man pages for all commands.
  * Multiple binary package support.
  * Support for specifying exactly what set of binary packages to act on,
    by group (arch or noarch), and by package name.
  * dh_clean: allow specification of additional files to remove as
    parameters.
  * dh_compress: fixed it to not compress doc/package/copyright
  * dh_installmanpage: allow listing of man pages that should not be 
    auto-installed as parameters.
  * dh_installdebfiles: make sure all installed files have proper ownerships
    and permissions.
  * dh_installdebfiles: only pass ELF files to dpkg-shlibdeps, and pass .so
    files.
  * Added a README.
  * dh_compress: changed behavior - debian/compress script is now run inside
    the package build directory it is to act on.
  * Added dh_lib symlink in debian/ so the debhelper apps used in this
    package's debian/rules always use the most up-to-date db_lib.
  * Changed dh_cleantmp commands in the examples rules files to dh_clean.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Sep 1997 12:26:12 -0400

debhelper (0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First release. This is a snapshot of my work so far, and it not yet
    ready to replace debstd.
