python-keyring (8.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Now this package contains only the recommended secure backends for each
  platform â€” on Linux these are the Secret Service backend and the KWallet
  D-Bus based backend.

  All the other backends have been moved to the new keyrings.alt package
  (which provides python-keyrings.alt and python3-keyrings.alt binaries).

  Please make sure you have keyrings.alt installed if you need to use the
  old backends (for example the file backend).

  See https://github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/117 for the reasoning of
  the split.
