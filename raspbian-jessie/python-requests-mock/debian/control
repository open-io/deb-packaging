Package: python-requests-mock
Architecture: all
Depends: python-requests,
         python-six,
         ${misc:Depends},
         ${python:Depends},
Description: mock out responses from the requests package - Python 2.x
 requests-mock provides a building block to stub out the HTTP requests_
 portions of your testing code. Everything in requests_ eventually goes through
 an adapter to do the transport work. requests-mock creates a custom adatper
 that allows you to predefine responses when certain URIs are called. There are
 then a number of methods provided to get the adapter used.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
