.SH NAME
fileop \- benchmark file operations

.SH SYNOPSIS
fileop [\-f X ]|[\-l # \fB\-u\fR #] [\-s Y] [\-t] [\-v] [\-e] [\-b] \fB\-[w]\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
Create a number of temporary files, then benchmark file operations on
them.  Given a force factor X (see option -f), X directories are
created in the current directory.  In each created directory, X
subdirectories are created.  Finally, in each of the X^2
subdirectories, X files are created, for a total of X^3 files.
The files are 1 byte, unless specified otherwise using -s.
