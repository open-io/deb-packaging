Kevin,

    What you are proposing sounds fine to me.  I can't
speak for William nor can I contact him as his email
address is no longer valid and there is no information
available on how to get in contact with him.

Current text in Iozone:

      Copyright 1991, 1992, 1994, 1998, 1999, 2002   William D. Norcott
  
   License to freely use and distribute this software is hereby granted 
   by the author, subject to the condition that this copyright notice 
   remains intact.  The author retains the exclusive right to publish 
   derivative works based on this work, including, but not limited to
   revised versions of this work.
------------------------

    The last time I spoke with Norcott I asked him about the intent
of the license. He indicated that anyone could use it and distribute
it for free.  The idea of the later sentence was to protect Iozone 
so that if someone modified it, the original author would still
have the right to publish future works that included any additions
that anyone might have made.  And, that all of the code that is
in Iozone could be used by the original author in other projects
that may or may not be freeware. Iozone's code is intended to
be freely available. It would not be in the spirit of the license
for someone to take the code out of Iozone, repackage it
into a commercial package, re-license it or patent it, and then 
prevent the original author of Iozone from using his own code.

    I can't see how your proposal would be a problem 
as you are not making changes and you are keeping the
original license text intact. You are not selling it or making
any claims that would prevent the authors of Iozone from 
continuing their development. Seems like it is perfectly
reasonable and well within the spirit of the license.

Note: Mandrake is already distributing Iozone, and there
are RedHat rpms for it. So this would certainly not
be a ground breaking activity. 

Should you ever find the need to modify Iozone, please
let me know of your changes and I will work with you 
to ensure that your changes are merged into the Iozone
source base. This will help your users keep up to date and
will reduce the merging activity that you would need to 
perform as future release of Iozone become available.

Please be sure to pick up the most recent version of Iozone
for your distribution. Iozone is available on 
http://www.iozone.org

Enjoy,
Don Capps

P.S. If you ever find Norcott please let me know. The 
last time I lost contact with him it was almost 8 years
before I found him again.  Norcott has not touched Iozone
for almost 10 years, and the only original lines in 
the current version of Iozone, from his original work,
are the Copyright and license statement. :-) He was
pleased with the direction that Iozone has taken but 
is not participating in any Iozone development.

Hello Don and William,

I am interested in distributing iozone3 in the non-free section of
Debian. According to your license, distribution of derivations is
forbidden.

I'm interested in "packaging" iozone3 in Debian in the non-free
section. This will not involve any source code changes. However, in
the most strict (i.e. safest) sense, a Debian package is a derivation
of the original since it involves combining the original with extra
information as well as lossless compression.

Thus, I seek your written permission via e-mail to distribute a Debian
package of the unmodified source code and also a Debian package of the
pre-compiled binary. Your copyright statement, as in all Debian
packages, would be included in the package.

Thanks for your consideration and your valuable tool,

		Note on Autobuilding
		====================

This license is non-free due to some sloppiness in construction: the
original license forbids distributing derivative works, while the
active author has granted an exception for Debian.

In short: iozone3 is in non-free, as far as I am aware, only due to
DFSG #8: License Must Not Be Specific to Debian.  I expect that it
can be safely autobuilt.

The header "XS-Autobuild: yes" is an indication that this package may
safely be autobuilt.  Please contact nonfree@release.debian.net before
changing that.

See http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/11/msg00012.html
