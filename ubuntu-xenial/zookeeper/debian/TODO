TODO for zookeeper package
==========================

 * create manpages for scripts and cli_mt and link them to /usr/bin
 * better names for the executables, like zk_* or zk-*
 * transition to multi-arch
 * enable test suite; invalid snapshot and upgrade testing will need
   to be disabled as they rely on non-DFSG compliant files.
