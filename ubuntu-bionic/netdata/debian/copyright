    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO

    RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS

 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
 of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
 the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the
 ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural
 and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
 she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
 elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under
 its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those
 rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
    protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright
    and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
    limited to, the following:
 .
    i.   the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
         communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
    ii.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
         performer(s);
 .
    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
         likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
    iv.  rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a
         Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
    v.   rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse
         of data in a Work;
 .
    vi.  database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC
         of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on
         the legal protection of databases, and under any national
         implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version
         of such directive); and
 .
    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout
         the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
         implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
 contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
 permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
 surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
 associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown
 (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
 the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
 of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
 limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
 "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of
 the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
 successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
 revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal
 or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the
 public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
 then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
 taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In
 addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants
 to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
 sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
 exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all
 territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
 applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in
 any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for
 any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
 be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
 Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
 invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
 ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and
 in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with
 respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
    a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
       abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
       document.
 .
    b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
       warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
       statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
       title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
       infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
       or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,
       all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
    c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
       persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
       without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
       Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
       necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use
       of the Work.
 .
    d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is
       not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with
       respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
