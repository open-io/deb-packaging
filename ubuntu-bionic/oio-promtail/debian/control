Description: Logging agent for loki
 Promtail is an agent which ships the contents of local logs to a private Loki
 instance or Grafana Cloud. It is usually deployed to every machine that has
 applications needed to be monitored. It primarily:
  * Discovers targets
  * Attaches labels to log streams
  * Pushes them to the Loki instance.
